Iâ€™m currently an A.B. Duke Scholar at Duke University advised by Cynthia Rudin. Through my research, I hope to enable learning with less labels. This makes me particularly interested in representation learning, generative modeling, and self-supervised methods as well as their intersections. 

In Fall 2020, I will be starting a PhD in Computer Science at Columbia University, exploring these topics. My doctoral work is supported by a Columbia Presidential Fellowship and an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship. 

In my undergraduate work, I conducted research on applying generative models to other machine learning tasks (such as image super-resolution and reinforcement learning), as well as on fundamental techniques developing such models (especially normalizing flows). In industry, I have spent time working on data science/machine learning for neurotech and for cold storage logistics.
